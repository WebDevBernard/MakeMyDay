# Make My Day

## Summary

TLDR: A trello clone with a task and project view.

Make My Day is a project management app that allows small teams to track tasks and communicate with other team members. Features of this app include:

Project View:

- Users can create new projects and filter users by project
- Users can chat with other users in the same project

Task View:

- Users can create new tasks, new tasks are automatically created in the in-progress section
- Users can drag and drop tasks to either the in-progress, backlog, on-hold or completed sections
- Tasks can be assigned to team members and filtered by user
- Automatic sorting: tasks are sorted by priority (low, med, high). Tasks with equal priority are sorted by due date.
- Gantt chart displays a visual of all tasks. Users can change dates by dragging bars left or right.

We made this app as part our final group project at Lighthouse Labs.
